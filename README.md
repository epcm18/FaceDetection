# Real-Time Face Detection with AI using Face API JS

This project sets up real-time face detection through a webcam using AI. The AI is so quick that it can draw in real-time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video without much performance overhead. We use the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow to set up the face detection.
